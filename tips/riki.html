		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Smoke Screen. Great silence, great blind, great slow, great range. So don't hotbox your gank target in
				the center of the cloud unless you're terrified of them casting something, just leave them near the edge
				of the AoE. By reflex, most enemies won't even realize that you duped them until they're halfway through
				the cloud.</li>
			<li>You can Blink Strike to allies as well as enemies. And like all other pseudo-Blinks you can cast it
				while Frostbitten or Ensnared.</li>
			<li>Blink Strike works on couriers.</li>
			<li>You still have collision when you're in Permanent Invisibility, so don't bump into enemies you're
				stalking.</li>
			<li>Riki has ridiculously high armor to start (5.7), but you also have like no HP to back it up. You're
				armored jello until you get a damage block item like Poor Man's Shield or more HP.</li>
			<li>Diffusal Blade is considered core on Riki for three main reasons: 1. Riki loves AGI items. 2. You can
				Purge enemies to keep them in your Smoke Screen even longer. 3. You can Purge Dust, you can Purge
				Amplify Damage, and you can Purge Track off yourself.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>

			<li><i>♪ Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit greedy when you realize that you've got no
				   farm. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit tired of listening to all the 'missing'
				   calls. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit nervous when you're in your jungle
				   without any wards. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit scared 'cause now you're
				   standing in a purple cloud. AND I NEED A STUN RIGHT NOW, AND I NEED ONE MORE THAN EVER. ♪</i> Rikis
																												 hate
																												 attacking
																												 heroes
																												 who
																												 decide
																												 to hold
																												 a
																												 staring
																												 contest
																												 rather
																												 than
																												 run
																												 scared.
																												 He is
																												 practically
																												 working
																												 with a
																												 Double
																												 Damage
																												 rune
																												 from
																												 Backstab
																												 when
																												 your
																												 back is
																												 turned,
																												 so if
																												 you
																												 think
																												 you can
																												 last
																												 the
																												 Smoke's
																												 duration,
																												 turn
																												 around
																												 and
																												 have a
																												 chat
																												 with
																												 him.
																												 Most of
																												 your
																												 attacks
																												 will
																												 miss,
																												 and
																												 you're
																												 still
																												 going
																												 to be
																												 silenced,
																												 but if
																												 backup
																												 is
																												 coming,
																												 fight
																												 him.
																												 All of
																												 this is
																												 assuming
																												 that
																												 you're
																												 not
																												 playing
																												 Bristleback,
																												 though.</li>
			<li>Good anti-Riki items as a support include pretty much any mid-game support item. Smoke Screen stops you
				from using spells, not items. Force Staff is the typical pickup, Eul's is good, and Ghost Scepter is
				good. For late game, you'll pretty much always want to go for a Necro 3, Orchid, or Sheep.</li>
			<li>Riki holds a strong grudge against both King Bars. BKB and MKB are both good carry items against a Riki
				because they both allow you to fight in the Smoke.</li>
			<li>Practice the buddy system. Riki can't really deal with solo-ganking two heroes at the same time.</li>
			<li>Don't make it obvious that you have a Sentry Ward down in the lane unless you're ready to go for the
				kill.</li>
			<li>Keep your Spidey senses on point. If you notice that your hero is doing some peculiar pathing or stutter
				stepping for some reason, Riki's probably following you around, gently licking you.</li>
			<li>When pushing, place a Sentry Ward in/around/behind your team out of the Tower's sight. If your team
				hasn't been super aggressive with detection, it's highly likely that Riki is ghost riding your whip and
				waiting for the perfect Smoke.</li>
			<li>Dust of Appearance slows invis units by 20%. Since the only way Riki can force himself to become visible
				is by attacking, Dust is usually a huge pain for him to deal with when escaping.</li>
