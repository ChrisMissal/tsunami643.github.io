		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Drow not only has stupid long attack range, but she also has an orb effect. Abuse this in lane. If
				you're not able to get last hits because her animation blows, at least make life annoying for whoever is
				in your lane.</li>
			<li>Don't forget to turn off Frost Arrows if you have Lifesteal. The orbs don't stack.</li>
			<li>The knockback on Gust doesn't break channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.</li>
			<li>However, the knockback does move enemies, making it cancel Templar Assassin's Meld and Shadow Amulet.</li>
			<li>You have to activate Precision Aura manually if you want ranged summons like Visage's Familiars or
				Enigma's Eidolons to benefit from the Aura.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Get in her face. Even if you're eating tons of damage, there is nothing Drows hate more than someone in
				melee range of her. Besides losing half of her ult damage, you can usually scare Drows if you manmode on
				them. If you're a ranged hero and you're 1v1ing her, get within 400 range of her to disable
				Marksmanship.</li>
