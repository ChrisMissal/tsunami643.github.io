		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you select your Disruption illusions you can see how the enemy is skilling themselves since your
				illusions' skill points will mirror the enemy's. For example, since Shadow Demon is a popular pick
				against Anti-Mage (because the illusions will Mana Break AM), you can use this to see how AM is skilling
				himself (maxing Mana Break, maxing Blink, or taking stats).</li>
			<li>There are pretty much only two reasons why you should ever Disrupt an ally to save them. Either you're
				trying to burn off 2.5 seconds of a disable they're in or they're about to die and you're using it like
				a Shallow Grave. For slows, blinds, silences, or disarms, unless you're communicating with your allies,
				avoid Disrupting them. 9 times out of 10, people will get mad at you even if they were dead anyway.</li>
			<li>However, there are tons of great situations to use Disruption on allies in other situations. During
				tower pushes, make more Lunas for maximum glaives. During defenses, make fake Batriders and send one in.
				When warding, make more yous to bait a gank attempt.</li>
			<li>Soul Catcher will never catch siege creeps.</li>
			<li>Disruption banishes a target for 2.5 seconds. Blink Dagger's damage cooldown is 3 seconds. Cast a Shadow
				Poison while a target is Disrupted to keep their Blink Dagger on cooldown. You don't even need to use
				the Detonate because the impact damage from the Shadow Poison will disable Blink Dagger and then they'll
				immediately take damage from the illusions afterwards.</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison is a great spell to use to stack camps because of its ludicrous range and cheap mana cost.
				For maximum supportage, angle yourself so you can stack two camps with one Shadow Poison.</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison is another great spell to draw creep aggro off a tower during defenses.</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison's projectile gives flying vision as it travels.</li>
			<li>Demonic Purge is essentially a Diffusal Blade purge that can go through spell immunity. This includes
				the ability to remove runes. However, this does <i>not</i> include the ability to instagib Warlock's
				Golem. That's still reserved exclusively for the Diffy Blade.</li>
			<li>Demonic Purge can damage and slow enemy couriers.</li>
			<li>Agh upgraded Demonic Purge disables passive abilities (like how Doom does).</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Get a Magic Stick if he's spamming Shadow Poison.</li>
			<li>The only reason Shadow Poison is balanced is because the projectile is very easy to dodge. Don't get
				lazy. You won't see a fat 4 above your head, but you can look in your status bar to see how many stacks
				are on you. If you've bumbled your way into 3 stacks, back off.</li>
			<li>The only reason Soul Catcher is balanced is because it's extremely hard to land, especially in the
				laning phase. Being a ranged hero will actually work against you when laning against SD because your
				natural positioning makes you easy pickings for a Soul Catchin'.</li>
