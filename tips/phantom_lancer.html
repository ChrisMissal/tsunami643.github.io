		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Doppelganger allows you to travel up and down cliffs.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger breaks trees upon landing. Use this to find juking enemies or to create quicker jungle
				routes.</li>
			<li>Treat Doppelganger like Puck's Phase Shift when playing against a team with a lot of projectile
				spells.</li>
			<li>The brighter of the two illusions from Doppelganger is the one that takes 100% damage</li>
			<li>Doppelganger dispels everything that a Manta Style can dispel (other than silences, obviously). This
				means that you should generally save it for escaping.</li>
			<li>That doesn't mean you should play conservatively, though. Between Doppelganger, Diffusal, and Manta, you
				have a ton of ways to wipe debuffs off, so play aggressive if the enemy team lacks hard stuns.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger has no cast time, but turning does take time. If you get jumped by an enemy and you don't
				have much time to react, cast Doppelganger in front of you.</li>
			<li>You can get cute with denies by Rushing to an enemy creep and then changing targets to your creep right
				as you reach the wave.</li>
			<li>If you attack command a rune (A+left click) PL will Rush to it. Just be sure to cancel the Rush before
				the attack completes.</li>
			<li>Don't forget to utilize Phantom Rush when escaping. Sprint to a neutral or enemy lane creep to get the
				speed boost. Phantom Rush will even work on enemy buildings or ward units.</li>
			<li>If you see a unit across a cliff, but you're in Phantom Rush range, PL will sprint to it taking the
				quickest pathing possible.</li>
			<li>When tower diving, A+left click your illusions during attack backswings to attempt to shake tower aggro
				momentarily.</li>
			<li>Also use A+left click when taking jungle camps to relieve yourself of creep aggro once you generate some
				illusions.</li>
			<li><b>ENABLE UNIFIED UNIT ORDERS WHEN PLAYING PL.</b> I preach the virtues of this option for pretty much
				every hero, but it's incredibly important when playing PL. The main reason is so that when you exit
				Doppelganger, you and all the illusions generated will move uniformly like Olympic synchronized swimmers.
				Box selecting will get you killed.</li>
			<li>Much like every other illusion hero out there, you can sometimes be tricky by microing an illusion out
				of the pack to bait enemies into thinking it's the real you.</li>
			<li>Illusions will <i>always</i> spawn with Phantom Rush off cooldown. This is exceptionally irritating for
				enemies to deal with after you pick up a Diffusal Blade since you can just keep Rushing fresh illusions
				on any enemies in the vicinity. If you're pushing a tower and you make some illusions off the creep
				wave, consider immediately Rushing them on defending enemies to zone them out.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Doppelganger is PL's only real escape, so try to bait it out by animation canceling stuns.</li>
			<li>Some debuffs that can help identify the real PL and won't be purged off by Doppel: Soul Catcher,
				Enfeeble, Weave, Fury Swipes, Burning Spears, Deafening Blast, Viper Strike, Fate's Edict, Rupture,
				Veil's active.</li>
			<li>Mjollnir's Static Shield will have a chance to proc off of every PL illusion whacking you.</li>
			<li>Crimson Guard's active basically neutralizes all illusion damage, though you'll still take the mana burn
				from Diffusal.</li>
			<li>Late game PL is pretty much all physical damage, so build armor.</li>
		</ul>
