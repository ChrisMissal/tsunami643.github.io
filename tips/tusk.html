		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards has beastly range, but the projectile travels pretty slow. If you're going for a long range
				Shard, try to save it for when the enemy is moving into a chokepoint or just block the choke in advance.</li>
			<li>Ice Shards provides vision for 2 seconds.</li>
			<li>You, and anyone else in you wrap up, are completely invulnerable when rolling in a Snowball. This means
				that you can use this as a poor man's banish to protect allies if they're about to get killed.</li>
			<li>You can cast spells while you're in the Snowball.</li>
			<li>You can pick up new heroes while you're rolling mid-Snowball.</li>
			<li>You can load the Sigil into your Snowball.</li>
			<li>Use the Sigil, please. It gives flying vision and it can slow spell immune enemies. Just don't feed it,
				because it's worth a fair amount of gold.</li>
			<li>Walrus Punch breaks channels, even if the enemy is spell immune.</li>
			<li>You can Walrus Punch the courier.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards is dangerous in lane because of how it affects pathing. You need to add some extra space in
				your safe zone to compensate for it. The distance you have to move to walk out of the Shards doesn't
				seem like much, but you set yourself up for skillshot disables or free harass.</li>
			<li>Tusk and all his allies are invincible in his Snowball, so don't cast your spells until the ball breaks
				apart.</li>
		</ul>
