		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Rocket Barrage is incredibly deadly at early levels. Spend time roaming around in the jungle if you can
				to catch out unsuspecting junglers or supports.</li>
			<li>Rocket Barrage hits siege creeps.</li>
			<li>You can use Force Staff on the Homing Missile for some reason.</li>
			<li>Stack ancients if you're carrying with Gyro. Flak Cannon will hit every single unit in the AoE for the
				same damage. The spell is basically built to exploit stacking.</li>
			<li>Flak Cannon hits creeps if you're targeting a tower, but it won't hit the tower if you're attacking
				creeps.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Taking on Gyrocopter 1v1 in the early or mid game is probably suicidal. A level 4 Rocket Barrage will
				deal 690 magic damage to you if you eat all of it. Get a huddle going with your creeps if Gyro is trying
				to make a move on you.</li>
			<li>If you're at low HP, it can be smarter to eat the rocket early than gamble that your tower will be able
				to kill it before it reaches Spirit Breaking speeds.</li>
			<li>Creeps can't kill the rocket. While they draw aggro from it, only tower shots or hero attacks can damage
				it.</li>
			<li>Ward this guy's ancients or just pop in real quick and kill his dominated creep. Or even better yet, win
				a team fight and then take his stacks.</li>
