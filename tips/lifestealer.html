		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can TP while Raged. If you're TPing back to base and you have at least 150 mana (75 for Rage, 75 for
				the TP) there are very few situations in which you shouldn't use this.</li>
			<li>So you got caught out and now you're being slowly escorted down the lane by five enemy heroes while
				you're meditating inside one of their ranged creeps (always Infest the enemy ranged creep when in this
				situation, it'll take the longest time to die naturally). Use the aforementioned tip. Wait for Rage to
				come off cooldown, pop it the second you bust out, and try to TP.</li>
			<li>Controlling a creep while infested won't break the creep's cover. This means that enemies won't be able
				to kill one of their own summons/creeps even when you start walking it back to your fountain.</li>
			<li>Learn how to choke-point jungle if you're going to jungle with him. Naix is one of the best to do it
				with.</li>
			<li>Avoid initiating team fights with Open Wounds. This skill is your free Satanic. When you're about to
				die, crack Pudge open like a coconut and drink his blood. The slow is useful in 1v1 or gank situations,
				but the massive lifesteal is invaluable in team fights.</li>
			<li>Midasing a creep that has Open Wounds on it will heal you.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>OH MASTA, LOOK AT ALL THESE SUPPORTS KITING ME. Ghost Scepter, Force Staff, Blink Dagger and Shiva's
				Guard are all great pickups against a Naix. As is a TP scroll if he hasn't gotten a Basher yet.</li>
			<li>If you have a lot of HP, stay away from him. Lifestealer likes killing people, but he also like stealing
				life. He'll gladly get kited by Luna if it means that he can paw at the nearby Centaur Warrunner a few
				times to get up to half HP.</li>
			<li>You want to strongly avoid building a Heart against a Naix for the same reason. Feast will deal more
				damage to you and heal him more if you have a lot of HP.</li>
			<li>It's okay to stack stuns on Naix, mainly because Rage has no cast time. As a result, he'll probably be
				able to get out of most situations unless you're secretly a bot.</li>
			<li>Every initiator becomes twice as fearsome when Naix is on the enemy team. Storm Spirit, Clockwerk,
				Batrider, Wisp, Nature's Prophet, etc, are all Mk. IV Naix Bombers. Even other units like the Spirit
				Bear, Beastmaster Hawk, Brood Spiders, Lycan Wolves, etc, all become things to fear.</li>
		</ul>
