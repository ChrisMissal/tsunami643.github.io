		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You're only getting the second Starstorm hit on a target if it's in 325 range of you.</li>
			<li>The idea behind landing consistent arrows is trying to throw them in a way that gives you a large window
				to hit a target and a small window for them to notice the arrow. If you're tossing out arrows that are
				90 degrees opposite your target, you're giving yourself a very small frame for the arrow to hit. It can
				be smart to sacrifice some time of the target running to give yourself a more forgiving/parallel angle.</li>
			<li>The more realistic idea behind landing consistent arrows is pairing it with other stuns or disables.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the map to see if you can use Moonlight Shadow to help out teammates.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If there's a Mirana on the enemy team, treat her like a Pudge as far as movement and positioning is
				concerned. Hug creeps, don't stand still, and get mad at your teammates for being arrow magnets.</li>
			<li>If you suspect Mirana is hanging around a tower that you're TPing to, target your TP directly on to the
				tower. You'll show up at a random spot in a circle around the tower, making it difficult for her to
				predict an arrow.</li>
			<li>Moonlight Shadow lasts 15 seconds. That's an eternity in Dota time. You really need a ton of sentry
				wards and dust whenever you're pushing into a competent team that has a PotM.</li>
