		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Fortune's End is basically the only cheap offensive purge in the game, so here are some buffs worth
				noting that can be purged: Aphotic Shield, Strafe, Surge, Flame Guard, Empower, Enrage, Ghost Scepter,
				Crimson Guard's active, and Haste/Invis/DD runes.</li>
			<li>Everything in the AoE of the Fortune's End projectile gets purged upon landing.</li>
			<li>The damage on Fortune's End <i>does not scale</i> the longer you channel it. This isn't Powershot. Only
				the 'stop' duration scales.</li>
			<li>And honestly, the 'stop' aspect of Fortune's End is the least important part. The main reason you use
				this spell is for the purge and the damage.</li>
			<li><b>Break the Fortune's End channel by casting Purifying Flames on your target.</b> Purifying Flames has
																								   a 100 more cast range
																								   than Fortune's End so
																								   it'll always be in
																								   range if you're quick
																								   to break it and the
																								   Fortune's End purge
																								   projectile will
																								   automatically take
																								   off the healing
																								   aspect. This won't
																								   work if your target
																								   is less than 400
																								   distance away from
																								   you since the
																								   Fortune's End
																								   projectile will land
																								   too quickly.</li>
			<li>You can target and channel Fortune's End on a Cycloned target. Releasing the projectile won't cancel a
				cyclone, though.</li>
			<li>Don't use Fate's Edict offensively unless you're a 100% sure your team fully understands how the spell
				works. Yes I know it's a great disarm, yes I know in increases pure and physical damage, but people are
				dumb and get mad at you for making the enemy immune to magic damage.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict can't be purged by anything except for Fortune's End or going spell immune.</li>
			<li>This is core knowledge for playing Oracle: Cast Fate's Edict first on an ally before Flaming them.
				They'll be immune to <s>hurt feelings</s> the nuke damage, but still get the heal.</li>
			<li>Once maxed, each full duration Flame will give ~120 HP to a hero (enemy or ally) with standard magic
				resistance.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict works on Rosh and I have no idea why. When Oracle was first released, I was like, "Well
				this is definitely a bug. A 6 second downtime disarm on Rosh that gives bonus damage for 50 mana? How'd
				this one slip by Valve." Noâ€¦ no, it's intentional.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames and Fate's Edict both work on enemy, allied, or neutral creeps. If you Fate's Edict any
				lane creep, they immediately stop pathing and just stand around for some reason.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames will never deal lethal damage to allied heroes or allied creeps/summons.</li>
			<li>You can get ninja denies on your creeps by Purifying them and then immediately going for the deny attack
				to finish them off.</li>
			<li>You almost never want to cast Purifying Flames on an enemy unless you're absolutely sure you can purge
				it or you're sure you can kill the target in the next ~5 seconds (it takes 6 seconds for the heal to
				compensate the damage with 25% magic resistance).</li>
			<li>False Promise is your highest range spell. If you're trying to save someone, don't bother Edicting, or
				Flaming them first, just use False Promise right off the bat.</li>
			<li>You can False Promise creep-hero units like Warlock's Golem or the Spirit Bear.</li>
			<li>The globe effect above a False Promised hero indicates the current state of damage. A green orb means
				they've healed more and a fiery red orb means they've taken more damage.</li>
			<li>A Fortune's Ended hero can never have their Blink Dagger broken.</li>
			<li>The only ways of cheating a False Promise death are with Dazzle's Shallow Grave or Abaddon's Borrowed
				Time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Culling Blade can kill through False Promise.</li>
			<li>Even though False Promise is constantly purging, disables do work for a moment. So feel confident about
				canceling a channeling enemy who's Promised.</li>
		</ul>
