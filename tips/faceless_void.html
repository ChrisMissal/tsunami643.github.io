		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You're invulnerable when using Time Walk. While not always practical, you can use this to run head first
				into projectiles like Wraith King's Wraithfire Blast to evade the stun.</li>
			<li>Tread switching is especially important to utilize on Void. Time Walk restores flat HP, so you stand to 
				benefit a lot by switching to INT treads for the mana and going back to STR after rewinding damage.</li>
			<li>Chronosphere reveals invisible units. If an enemy decided to stop fighting you and Shadow Bladed out,
				cast a Chrono along the path and laugh maniacally when you discover him without any sort of detection.</li>
			<li>Time Dilation makes Void a very annoying counter for heroes with low cooldown spells like, Timbersaw,
				Bristleback, Invoker, Tinker, Lina, Puck, Zeus, Kunkka, Weaver, Legion Commander, Queen of Pain, Storm Spirit,
				Phantom Assassin, Spirit Breaker (Greater Bash has a cooldown that gets frozen), Slark (as long as he
				doesn't Death Pact the debuff off first).</li>
			<li>Donkeys in the Dota universe have a stronger grip on space and time than most heroes. Chronosphere will
				not freeze the enemy courier.</li>
			<li>Any units owned by you can move around in a Chronosphere. This makes Necrobook or Manta Void viable
				builds for more deeps in your Chrono.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The Time Dilation debuff can be purged/dispelled.</li>
			<li>Eul's is one of the cheapest counters to Chronosphere. Voids rarely go BKB so as long as you're not
				caught in a Chrono, you should be able to waste a good 2.5s of Chrono time by Cycloning him. Plus, it'll
				purge off Mask of Madness's active.</li>
			<li>Void can freely walk through any Chronosphere. Keep this in mind if you're playing Rubick or trying to
				be tricky in Ability Draft.</li>
		</ul>
