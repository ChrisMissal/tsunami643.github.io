		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You're invulnerable when using Time Walk. While not always practical, you can use this to run head first
				into projectiles like Wraith King's stun or KotL's ponies and then just start whaling on them.</li>
			<li>Chronosphere reveals invisible units. If an enemy decided to stop fighting you and Shadow Bladed out,
				cast a Chrono along the path and laugh maniacally when you discover him without any sort of detection.</li>
			<li>Donkeys in the Dota universe have a stronger grip on space and time than most heroes. Chronosphere will
				not freeze the enemy courier.</li>
			<li>Any units owned by you can move around in a Chronosphere. This makes Necrobook or Manta Void viable
				builds for more deeps in your Chrono.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Eul's is one of the cheapest counters to Chronosphere. Voids rarely go BKB so as long as you're not
				caught in a Chrono, you should be able to waste a good 2.5s of Chrono time by Cycloning him. Plus, it'll
				purge off Mask of Madness's active.</li>
			<li>MKB doesn't counter Backtrack and BKB doesn't counter Time Lock. What I'm saying is, you better end the
				game fast because Void don't care what items you built.</li>
			<li>Void can freely walk through any Chronosphere. Keep this in mind if you're playing Rubick or trying to
				be tricky in Ability Draft.</li>
