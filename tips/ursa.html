		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Earthshock is ridiculously good slow that gets little respect. Please skill it, it's nearly as good as
				Brewmaster's clap.</li>
			<li>You consume Overpower stacks on denial attacks.</li>
			<li>The duration on Overpower is 5 seconds longer than the cooldown. Meaning that before you go in for a
				gank or into Rosh, you should cast Overpower well in advance so the second cast is already in the
				chamber when you need it.</li>
			<li>When laning, try to keep Fury Swipe stacks up like you would Batrider's Sticky Napalm, especially
				against melee heroes. Ursa has very high base armor, so he can take abuse quite well.</li>
			<li>Ursa has probably the most flexible item options of any AGI carry in the game (yes, he's AGI). Really
				the only item he <i>'needs'</i> is Vlad's/Morbid Mask, the rest situational. Any pair of boots can work,
				Blink or Shadow Blade/Silver Edge are good for initiation, Halberd can be great for manfights against
				bashlords, hell even Sheepstick or Eul's are great if you don't need anything else.</li>
			<li>Roshing for Dummies: Get Vlad's (or just a Morbid Mask if you're feeling saucy), get Smoke, cast Smoke,
				TP to nearest tower, cast Overpower, wait a couple of seconds, run into the Rosh pit, chop Rosh, cast
				Overpower again immediately, UHHUHAUAHUAH IMMORTALITY.</li>
			<li>Take the time to check runes during the laning phase as Ursa. Getting a Haste rune is basically an all
				expenses paid trip to first blood.</li>
			<li>Enrage purges you when you cast it. Use it to wipe off DoTs, or slows, or blinds, or ensnares.</li>
			<li>TAKE THE ROSH TIMER WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GRIZZLY-ASS, POLAR-ASS, BROWN-ASS, BLACK-ASS,
				APPARENTLY-GIANT-PANDAS-ARE-ALSO-A-MEMBER-OF-THE-BEAR-FAMILY-ASS HERO.
				<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">bind "b" "chatwheel_say 57" //Current Game Time</font><br><br>
				Paste that in your Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg\autoexec.cfg and you can note the time
				whenever you press B. Ballers, you're putting numbers on the boards.</li>
			<li>If you're too lazy to do that, then alt+click on the clock or enable 'Current Time' in your chat
				wheel.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ursa has no stuns, so keep your finger on the TP when you see him moseying on down towards you.</li>
			<li>You really need at least one Force Staff on your team against Ursa, preferably more. After that, Eul's,
				Sheep, and Ghost Scepter are all good support items against Ursa.</li>
			<li>Keep eyes in and on the Rosh pit when you know it's up. If you have a spell that can give you lasting
				vision inside the pit (Techies mines, TA traps), get one in before his first Rosh.</li>
			<li>Good carry items against Ursa are Basher/Abyssal, Manta, Halberd, and sometimes Ethereal Blade.</li>
			<li>Ursa can purge himself with Enrage, heroes with unpurgeable abilities like Invoker's Deafening Blast,
				Viper's Viper Strike, Oracle's Fate's Edict, or Bloodseeker's Rupture quite useful. Enrage also can't
				purge off the Heaven's Halberd disarm.</li>
			<li>You can purge Enrage and Overpower stacks off of Ursa, making heroes like Shadow Demon or Oracle fairly
				good.</li>
			<li>Be wary of Level 1 Rosh attempts when Wraith King, Lone Druid, Vengeful Spirit, or Io are on Ursa's
				team.</li>
