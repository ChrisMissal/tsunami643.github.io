		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Use Waveform to travel between and damage two jungle camps at the same time.</li>
			<li>Waveform can be used to absorb certain projectiles headfirst since you are invincible during the
				spell.</li>
			<li>When using Waveform to push the lane, move near the ranged creep in the enemy wave and Waveform in
				towards your creeps or into trees. You make yourself vulnerable to ganks if you Waveform deeper into
				enemy territory.</li>
			<li>When one Adaptive Strike is cast, the other goes into cooldown for 3 seconds.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Attribute Shift while stunned/disabled and while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>Casting Morph applies a basic dispel on your hero.</li>
			<li>Mechanics on Morphs:
				<ul>
				<li>Morphs take the target hero's base STR, AGI, INT, primary attribute, and movespeed on cast. You do not get the hero's base
					armor, base damage, BAT, or talents.</li>
				<li>Morphs will keep Morphling's items and you can use them normally as the Morphed hero.</li>
				<li>Morphs copy the current <i>percentage</i> of HP/Mana on Morphling when cast.</li>
				<li>When un-Morphing, you will return to the HP/Mana you had as Morphling before you Morphed.</li>
				<li>Some non-ultimate passives transfer to the Morph, but some don't. Like Void, Troll, and Slardar's bashes do,
					but not Spirit Breaker's. Don't ask me, bruh.</li>
				<li>If you make a Morph of a target that has an Agh granted basic spell (Treant Protector's Eyes in the Forest,
					for example) then your Morph will have that spell as well if the target has their Scepter.</li>
				<li>Morphs spawn with a full set of Stone Remnant, Leap, and Shrapnel charges, but only one Spirit Siphon charge and two Spin Web
					charges.</li>
				<li>A Morph timing out behaves the same way as Rubick's Spell Steal timing out in terms of spells/summons lingering.</li>
				<li>If you Morph a target that's in a Transformation, your Morph will spawn Transformed. The bonuses are <i>massively</i> inconsistent, though,
					and not worth listing.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Morphling cannot Waveform when rooted.</li>
			<li>You need to have nukes if you want to kill Morphling. With STR Attribute Shift, he can usually gain HP before you can
				burn him down with auto attacks.</li>
			<li>Silences and hexes are also a good option to prevent him from starting to Attribute Shift.</li>
			<li>You can see how much time Morphling has left in a Morph by clicking it and checking the buff timer.</li>
			<li>The level number shown next to a Morph's HP is the same level as the real Morphling, not the same level as the hero
				morphed.</li>
