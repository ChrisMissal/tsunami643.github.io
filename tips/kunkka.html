		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Abuse Torrent's huge cast range. The spell has a very obvious cast animation and will likely get juked
				if the enemy sees you Bellamy salute. Cast it from the fog or high ground or combo it with a ally stun.</li>
			<li>If you get trapped in trees, you can Torrent the enemy and walk underneath them.</li>
			<li>Torrent has multiple ticks of damage, making it useful for burning off things like Treant's Living Armor
				or Templar Assassin's Refraction.</li>
			<li>If you want to be cute, you can cast X on yourself or an ally before getting Teleported somewhere. You
				can use this to quickly go back home, get a few bottle charges or pick up something from the shop, and
				then quickly come back on the lane.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If Kunkka's sword is glowing, get ready to receive a face full of Tidebringer.</li>
			<li>The splash effect on Tidebringer is visible on invisible units. Don't sneak around in front of a Kunkka
				if you're invisible because he will likely wonder why there was a poof of water on nothing.</li>
			<li>Going spell immune mid-X will prevent you from getting returned. Cycloning yourself with Eul's can also
				dodge it, but you need to time it.</li>
