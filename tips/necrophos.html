		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>"Nah he's dead, Death Pulse will kill him." HAHAHAHA, no. Death Pulse never gets them. Somehow people
				will always heal just barely enough HP just in time that the skull won't kill them. Always finish the
				kill either with Heartstopper, Scythe, or auto attacks.</li>
			<li>Death Pulse can hit invis and fogged units.</li>
			<li>People skip Heartstopper Aura because it pushes the lane. Oh does it? Does it really? Yes it does, it's
				about one auto attack per every melee creep in the wave's worth of damage at level 1. People also assume
				it's worthless because they aren't seeing a huge white chunk growing on the enemies HP bar. Heartstopper
				is the long con. Enemies will suddenly realize they have a strong urge to eat tangoes and the support
				will wonder how they're losing so much HP every time they go to harass you. If you're in an aggressive
				lane, you should definitely get at least one level of this spell. If you're in a defensive lane, you
				should still consider it.</li>
			<li>The stun on Reaper's Scythe goes through BKB. That's neat.</li>
			<li>For heroes with standard magic resistance the magic numbers for getting a kill with Scythe are at
				23%/31%/40% of HP remaining.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're on the run from a potentially fatal Death Pulse, a cute tactic is to get the courier to use a
				Salve on you to bypass the brief cast time of popping open the flask and lathering up.</li>
			<li>You can't disjoint Death Pulse, so don't bother trying.</li>
			<li>Glimmer Cape absolutely obliterates Necro. Save it for when he's Scything a target and then be amazed at
				how little damage the Scythe does.</li>
