		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The reason Eul's is strong on AA is because Cold Feet+Cyclone pretty much ensures that an enemy won't be
				able to run out of the Cold Feet trigger radius. However, a lot of AAs go tunnel vision when finding a
				high priority target and try to pull this combo on them. As a result, you probably just Cycloned an
				enemy Phantom Assassin out of Ravage because you were being a greedy bitch. In chases and ganks, the
				Cyclone+Cold Feet can be useful, but avoid using it in team fights. If anything, save the Cyclone for
				yourself.</li>
			<li>Ice Vortex is more than a massive range slow. It's also a 275 radius Veil of Discord that lowers magic
				resistance. Throw them all over the place when you're pushing and try to ult people when they're sitting
				in a Vortex for massive damage. Keep this in mind if you're skilling Chilling Touch as well, since
				Chilling Touch deals Magical damage.</li>
			<li>Ice Vortex is also a great scouting tool with the vision it provides. Use it to scout out Rosh attempts
				or to check high ground or to help with counterwarding.</li>
			<li>Ice Blast is a great way to break Blink Daggers for 8+3/9+3/10+3 seconds or 17+3 with Agh (the +3 is the
				time it takes for the Dagger to unbreak after the last tick of damage). You don't even need to land the
				Blast. As long as they get the Frostbite debuff, an enemy's Dagger will stay broken for the whole
				duration. Use it before team fights on an enemy initiator.</li>
			<li>You or your allies can remove the Chilling Touch buff by clicking on the buff icon. This is literally
				the only buff in the game you can do this with.</li>
			<li>Shoot your ult farther than you think it should go in most short range encounters. The shatter debuff
				can be more useful than the nuke in some situations, and as long as an enemy along the path of the
				projectile, they'll get frosted. Plus, the Ice Blast projectile travels slow as hell at low ranges and
				it's very easy for people to retreat the second they see it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're walking back to the fountain at low HP and an enemy AA is alive, take a short break and try to
				bait the Ice Blast. It's worth spending a few extra seconds standing at your rax rather than risking
				getting blasted in your fountain.</li>
			<li>His ult is famous for having the game's most confusing tooltip. If you're against an AA, all you need to
				know is that if his ult flew over your head, you have a debuff that won't let you heal any HP. No
				lifesteal, no fountain regen, no Tranquil Boots, no Urn of Shadows, no PYOORIFICAYSHUN. Just you sitting
				and praying you don't drop below the shattering threshold.</li>
