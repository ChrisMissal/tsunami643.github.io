		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Press the Attack is as strong of a Dispel as Aphotic Shield. Please cast it on allies to wipe off
				disables.</li>
			<li>The standard max-greed Duel procedure is using Press the Attack, casting Overwhelming Odds on the
				target, activating any items (Solar Crest, Armlet, Blade Mail, BKB, Silver Edge), then Dueling your
				target. Like a Nyx Assassin, though, you'll need to trim ingredients in the combo as the game progresses
				in order to get the Duel off.</li>
			<li>Tread switching is an important thing to utilize on LC since she is a STR hero with fairly mana
				intensive spells. Remember to stay off STR treads until the healing from Press the Attack is complete,
				but also remember to not stay on INT treads for 15 minutes straight until someone pings you after a Duel
				loss and you sheepishly swap back.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Simple spells to mess with Duel: Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's False Promise, Wyvern's Cold Embrace,
				Bane's Nightmare, OD/SD/Tusk banishes.</li>
			<li>LC won't get Duel victories if Wraith King has an Agh and her target turns into a Wraith. However, she
				can Duel a Wraith for a pretty much guaranteed win if the Wraith times out mid-Duel. Consider getting WK
				Agh to counter her if she keeps jumping your team's initiators.</li>
			<li>LC loves going against teams with a bunch of summons, so draft accordingly.</li>
