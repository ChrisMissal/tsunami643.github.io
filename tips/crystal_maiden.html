		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Crystal Nova provides vision around the target radius for ~6 seconds making it useful to cast when
				trying to deward high ground or scout the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>Frostbite lasts for 10 seconds on creeps and will do 100 DPS at all levels (WOW THAT'S LIKE 1000
				DAMAGE). This allows you to grab some easy XP or ward money from a large neutral camp as one
				Frostbite+some auto attacks will usually be enough to kill the biggest creep in the camp. Just do your
				team a favor and try to finish the whole camp though. No one wants your leftovers.</li>
			<li>If you're going Battle Maiden, one item of choice is Shadow Blade/Shadow Amulet/Glimmer Cape since you
				can cast the invis while you're channeling your ult.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't underestimate her early game damage. If you don't have any stuns/silences, her ult will destroy
				you in a 1v1 support cage match.</li>
			<li>Frostbite will disable blinking spells (and obviously Blink Dagger). If you're an AM or QoP and CM is
				sauntering towards you, you can be sure that she has backup.</li>
			<li>In matches against CM, you'll often find yourself wondering, <i>"How does X have so much mana!?"</i> CM
				is why they have so much mana. So don't assume that just because AA has Chilled his Touch 3 times at
				level 2 that he's going to stop any time soon.</li>
