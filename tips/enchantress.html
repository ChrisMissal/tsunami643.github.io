		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Untouchable is a highly underrated skill. This makes you a real dick to trade hits with if you do choose
				to lane with her. It also makes you a great hero to tank Rosh since he attacks in bullet time.</li>
			<li>You can Enchant nearly every enemy/neutral units. Necronomicon creeps and enemy illusions are both A+++
				steals.</li>
			<li>You can re-cast Enchant on a controlled unit to refresh the duration.</li>
			<li>Impetus calculates the damage by the distance between you and the target once the projectile hits the
				target. Thus, after tossing an Imp, you can run back or Force Staff to get some more damage while it
				travels. Unfortunately, there's a cap at 2500 distance, so don't get a Blink Dagger… Although… that does
				sound intriguing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're a right clicker, try to let your supports take care of Bambi. You'll be wasting your time
				trying to kill her mid game when nukes will touch her Untouchable fluffy tail quicker than you can.</li>
