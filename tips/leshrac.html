		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The outrageously long cast animation on Split Earth is both a blessing and a curse. It's mainly a curse,
				but you can use it to your advantage. In lane, there are few things more irritating than seeing a
				Leshrac go all <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Crossing_the_Alps#mediaviewer/File:Napoleon4.jpg">Napoleon Crossing the Alps,</a>
				moving so you don't get stunned, and then him canceling the animation. You can also use the cast
				animation to stun people chasing you without having to turn around by casting it directly in front of
				your feet.</li>
			<li>When munching on a tower with Edict, become a zen master of positioning. Leshrac is one of the few
				heroes who can successfully push towers even while your creep wave changes aggro from the tower to the
				next enemy creep wave. Just stand in the corner of the AoE so that you're only seeing explosions
				underneath the tower and give her the edict. If you don't right click, you won't draw any aggro and the
				tower will continue attacking whichever unit is closest, which will still be the creeps.</li>
			<li>Try to bait out a glyph when you walk up to a tower before using Edict. Edict has a cast time, so try to
				cancel it during your T-pose. Most of the time people will just glyph the second they see Leshrac smugly
				standing alone by their tower, but it's still worth a shot.</li>
			<li>Edict can hit invisible units. Try chasing down invis enemies if you think they'll be traveling a
				predictable path.</li>
			<li>Eul's is an amazing item on Leshrac. If you're having a bad game and you know you're not going to be
				able to hold on to Bloodstone charges, consider getting a Eul's. If you're having a good game, still
				consider getting Eul's. Not only does it give amazing mana regen for the price, but it gives move speed
				and has one of the best synergy actives with Leshrac in the game. First of all Cyclone has no cast time
				and has pretty generous range, so when you're hunting someone down, just Cyclone them and then start
				priming a Split Earth. Secondly, Edict and Pulse Nova continue doling out damage around you even when
				you're Cycloned, so just run into the middle of the fight and start raving in the air for a free 2.5
				seconds of uninterrupted Pulse Nova'ing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Split Earth is one of the easiest stuns in the game to juke. It has an incredibly obvious cast animation
				and has an eternity of a cast time. It is usually worth running backwards a small distance just to dodge
				it.</li>
			<li>There's nothing a Leshrac hates more than ganking someone near creeps. It can be worth it to stand with
				your creep wave rather than trying to retreat if you're getting ganked by Leshrac with Edict turned on.
				You'd be surprised how little damage Edict does when it's diffused among 6 units.</li>
			<li>Don't glyph your structures until you see Leshrac turn on his Edict if he's pushing your towers.</li>
