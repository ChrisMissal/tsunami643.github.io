		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Breathe Fire hits siege creeps.</li>
			<li>Dragon Form's passive attack (Corrosive Breath) works on towers. This is what makes DK such a mean
				pusher early on.</li>
			<li>The transformation into Dragon Form is nearly as useful as the Dragon Form itself during the laning
				phase. No one ever expects you to suddenly go full Dragon and whip out a 450 range 2.5 second stun in
				the span of no seconds. People know how far to stand away from a DK in Knight form and people know to
				stand much further back from a DK in Dragon form. Don't give them the chance to adapt.</li>
			<li><i>STACK ANCIENTS!</i> Use a dominated creep to stack and then use your ult to take them down.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>In higher level games, keep watch on DK's ancients. Block them or kill his dominated creep if you're in
				the area. If you win a team fight and he's been stacking, hijack his stack with your team.</li>
