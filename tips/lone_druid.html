		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Swap into Druid form if: You're healing HP (you're healing a larger percentage of your HP in Druid
				form), you're running back or from base or running around from camp to camp in the jungle (you have
				higher MS in Druid form), or you're trying for pro jukes (you can dodge stuns/attacks while you're
				Transforming). Swap into Bear form if: Nearly everything else.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid of letting your Spirit Bear wander away from you. Use it to draw aggro from an incoming
				creep wave, stack jungle camps/ancients while you're freefarming, go shopping for you, go back to the
				Fountain to heal, burn down a creep wave or enemy jungle camp from across the map with Radiance, give a
				good position for Tinker to TP into, play blackjack with Death Prophet, or just scout for you.</li>
			<li>If your Spirit Bear just died and you're on the losing end of a team fight, don't just cast it again in
				the hopes that you can turn the fight around. Save it for when you respawn.</li>
			<li>Hold on to your skill point for your level 4 Spirit Bear until you get into a skirmish. Entangle has a
				5s cooldown and lasts for 3s on a hero. When you skill up the bear its cooldowns are refreshed, making
				it possible to potentially double-entangle your target.</li>
			<li>Leveling up the bear also resets its blink damage cooldown timer, allowing you to blink it back or
				immediately resummon it when you level it up.</li>
			<li>Whenever you Recall the bear, it always appears on the top-right of your hero, regardless of what
				direction you're facing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you see that the Spirit Bear suddenly has full HP in lane, it's a great time to kill Sylla since he
				probably just spawned a fresh one. If you manage to get him Bearless in lane, you just murdered his
				early game. If you manage to get him Bearless before a push, you get a tower for free.</li>
			<li>Killing the Spirit Bear will damage Lone Druid significantly. Sylla doesn't have much HP when he's not
				in True Form and killing his Spirit Bear will make the hero lose 10% of his max HP. Plus, the bear is
				worth a lot of gold.</li>
			<li>Lone Druid is one of those heroes that allows for easy level 1 Rosh attempts. If you see him and Ursa,
				Lich, Wraith King, VS or a lot of other heroes, be sure to police the Rosh pit when you spawn.</li>
