		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wraithfire Blast is a slow projectile and the animation is extremely obvious. Use the stun as close to
				the enemy as you can to prevent people from disjointing it or running away.</li>
			<li>Soul Ring is considered core on Wraith King to ensure that you'll have mana to Reincarnate at the last
				moment. Be sure to keep at least 10 mana in the bank, though, because Soul Ring will only give you 150.</li>
			<li>Sometimes it's advisable to sit on the skill point for Reincarnate. There's no point putting the spell
				on cooldown early on if your team can't take advantage of it, so decide to level it when you need it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Mana burns makes WK's life hard, even if he has a Soul Ring.</li>
			<li>The King and Ursa are total bros. If you see these two on the same team, they're probably going to try
				to take Rosh very early on.</li>
		</ul>
