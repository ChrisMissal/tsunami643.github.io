		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Since Ice Path has a lot of 'active time,' you can use it to pre-emptively disable enemies. This is good
				against things like Puck's Phase Shift, Io's Relocate, heroes who are Tornado'd, or heroes who are
				TP'ing in who like to immediately blink after.</li>
			<li>Ice Path gives vision as it travels. Use it to scout high ground or the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>Liquid Fire slows down tower attack speeds and is what makes Jakiro a great pusher. Pay attention to
				when it's off cool down and use it accordingly. This also makes Jakiro a good buddy to have during tower
				dives and solo Rosh attempts.</li>
			<li>Try to save Liquid Fire exclusively for the enemy hero in lane. Since it has an AoE, it can very quickly
				change the lane equilibrium if you cast it on creeps.</li>
			<li>No one likes fighting in a Macropyre. So if you don't want to fight, throw out a Macropyre. You can use
				it preemptively on your high ground if your teammates are dead to kill off the creep wave. It's not a
				big enough ult that it matters if you blow it, but it's annoying enough to discourage engagements.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Path has a long cast animation, but insane range. If you're running away from a gank, keep your
				camera on Jakiro to see if/when/where he is casting an Ice Path. The margin for error for him increases
				dramatically the further you get, but the stun will stay the same if you're caught in it.</li>
			<li>When Liquid Fire is off cooldown, the fire head starts glowing and dripping fire. Jakiro will use the
				fire head for all attacks until Liquid Fire is used.</li>
