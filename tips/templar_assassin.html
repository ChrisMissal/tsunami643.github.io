		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The bonus damage charges you get on Refraction don't get dropped on denial attacks. This is relevant for
				mid lane controlling purposes, because you can aggressively deny your creeps and push the lane at the
				same time with the spill.</li>
			<li>All damage sources are created equal on the temple steps. Whether it's a ranged creep, a tower shot, or
				a Laguna Blade, every instance of damage you take will wipe a Refraction charge off. As a TA, it's
				massively important to learn how to maintain creep aggro to ensure that creeps won't burn off Refraction
				charges.</li>
			<li>The cooldown on Refraction is the same as its duration. Before going in for a gank or joining a team
				fight, you want a fully charged Refraction to be on the tail end of its timer so you can put a fresh one
				up when everything inevitably starts going wrong.</li>
			<li>Meld has no cast time and no fade time. This is useful for disjointing spells, tower shots, and right
				clicks, but it's also huge for juking. When you're getting chased, Meld as soon as you get a moment of
				high ground above the enemies. If you're juking in the jungle, Meld as soon as you think you're in a
				split-second of fog.</li>
			<li>You have no collision when you're Melded, so you won't block pathways.</li>
			<li>For a good laugh, buy a Shadow Blade and cast Meld during the fade time. Then walk away a second later
				and watch the enemy team angrily attack the ground.</li>
			<li>If you have trouble landing Meld strikes in the heat of the moment, try using A+left click instead of
				right clicking on the enemy.</li>
			<li>Meld damage does not spill. So stop wasting mana Melding the front creep in a wave.</li>
			<li>The armor reduction debuff from Meld works on Rosh.</li>
			<li>To be an effective Lanaya, you've got to learn how to play Psi-Blades like a concert pianist. Each deny
				should effortlessly pick up a last hit in the same stroke. A full creep wave should be wiped in two
				spills after you pick up a Desolator. Move creeps and neutrals in the jungle around to get the perfect
				spills.</li>
			<li>Always go for denies. The Psi-Blade will spill even if the creep dies before your attack projectile
				hits.</li>
			<li>You can give shared control of your Traps to all of your teammates so they can detonate your Traps
				themselves. However, please notify your teammates that you're doing this otherwise you're going to
				sabotage their micro.</li>
			<li>The core Trap locations are the runes (or one rune), their side of the hill, your side of the hill,
				Rosh, and choke points on stairs. The rest is dealer's choice.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If TA is receiving the damage buff from Refraction, her Psi-Blades will be longer and glow redder.
				Personally, I can't tell the difference and I don't have the time to color match it at Home Depot when
				I'm dying under my tower, but it's true.</li>
			<li>DoT her Refraction. Venomancer, Viper, Radiance, etc. Spells that deal lots of instances of damage like
				Dark Pact, Torrent, or Rot are good too.</li>
			<li>Urn of Shadows can also break TA's Refraction, but it only ticks once every ~0.5s, so it's not very
				effective.</li>
			<li>You can't break TA's Meld with any stun or silence since Meld invisibility is an infinite duration buff
				(which is purgable), not a channeled spell. Your team really needs to have ground targeted or
				non-targeted spells otherwise she'll just sit there until her Blink comes off cooldown.</li>
			<li>However, spells that change her position like Flamebreak, Blinding Light, Power Cogs, Gust, or Fissure,
				can break Meld.</li>
			<li>Know what you're getting yourself into if you dive a TA. Can you handle her having Refraction? Do you
				have detection if she Melds? Will you be able to kill her if she has five Traps lying around?</li>
			<li>Always be moving around when you're against her mid. Make her miss last hits because she's too busy
				trying to position spill on you.</li>
			<li>If you're mid against Lanaya, get some sentry wards at around 6 minutes. Not only will this allow you to
				actually finish a gank on her if you get the upper hand, but you can also clear the Trap(s) that
				you know she has on your side of the hill.</li>
			<li>Smokes are great against teams with a TA since they will often be lazy when spamming observer wards if
				they can rely on Trap vision. On the other hand, you need to be careful that you're not smoking on top
				of a Trap.</li>
			<li>She almost definitely has a Trap in the Rosh pit, so either bring sentries or don't go for sneaky Rosh
				attempts against a TA.</li>
