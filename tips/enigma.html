		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be a bro and convert one of the mid lane's creeps at 0:00. You still have enough time to go back to the
				fountain and make it to the jungle without losing too much time.</li>
			<li>You can make Eidolons out of Eidolons, thus further Horcruxing it. The cooldown for Conversion gives you
				about ~0.5s to quickly convert an Eidolon before it disappears. This information is highly relevant
				during Rosh attempts.</li>
			<li>Jungle creeps have a tendency to use their spells whenever three units are in close proximity to them.
				If you just converted something, chances are your Eidolons will eat the damage, but if you're moving to
				a new camp with old Eidolons, spread them out so they don't trigger a spell.</li>
			<li>When jungling, be aware that you can drop neutral aggro off of your Eidolons the same way you can drop
				tower aggro. Select the Eidolon in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should
				lose interest in that Eidolon.</li>
			<li>Attacks on buildings or allied units do not increase the attack counter for Eidolon multiplication.</li>
			<li>I don't know why you can convert siege creeps into three Eniglets, but you can. This can speed up pushes
				significantly.</li>
			<li>Midnight Pulse breaks trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees
				during a chase, or to be super sneaky and carve a path to hide so you can easily blink in for huge Black
				Holes.</li>
			<li>If you're against a team with high mobility or lots of disables, don't bother with dropping the Midnight
				Pulse before Black Hole. If you're not, then go for the extra damage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Blink Dagger is a big deal on Enigma, especially if he's a team's sole initiator. If you can get a DoT
				or some damage on Enigma and then quickly initiate on their team, you can be sure that he will be
				furiously clicking his Blink Dagger but won't be able to do anything.</li>
			<li>"Hey guys don’t clump, I think Black Hole is off coo… GOD DAMN IT."</li>
			<li>Beastmaster is a solid pick against Enigma since he can stand on the other end of a Black Hole and still
				stun him out of BKB with Primal Roar. Vengeful Spirit is also a good pick since Nether Swap also
				penetrates spell immunity.</li>
