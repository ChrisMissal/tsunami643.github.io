		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember to change your orbs for their passive uses during the game. I know it's difficult to keep track
				and a lot of Invokers like to have their next spell Pre-Voked, but those 3 Wex orbs can make the
				difference between you catching up to an enemy or not. Or those 3 Quas orbs early on could save your
				life mid.</li>
			<li>Remember your stunning spells: Cold Snap, Deafening Blast, and technically Tornado. If you don't know
				what to cast and Invoke is off cool down, just use one of these (if you're leveling them accordingly,
				that is. Don't be tossing around Tornadoes with 1 Wex).</li>
			<li>Cold Snap has ridiculous range. Use it to cancel Bottle charges on the enemy mid from a distance if you
				have vision of them.</li>
			<li>Urn of Shadows can trigger a Cold Snap every ~0.5s.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to what your teammates are doing before you Tornado in a team fight. It's a great spell
				and all, but it also has Naga Sleep levels of destroying your teammates plans.</li>
			<li>Tornado has a purging effect that can take off runes or certain buffs, like Meld.</li>
			<li>I remember Alacrity's spell combo because every time I cast it, it's time to lay the
				<b>WWE Smackdown SHUT YOUR MOUTH.</b></li>
			<li>Alacrity can be cast on siege creeps. Tether+Overcharge and Bloodlust them as well for huge hyperexcited
				catapults.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits are invaluable for pushing. They have amazing range late game, serve as two extra damaging
				and tanking units, can cut off the creep wave, and they last forever.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits are also great if you're mid to serve as rune control. Spawn a Forge Spirit around 20
				seconds before the even minute mark and have it sit at the rune to kill it.</li>
			<li>Ghost Walk is QQW. I remember this because every time I get ganked I want to QQ... W.</li>
			<li>You can cast Ghost Walk while channeling a TP. Just don't change your orbs or Invoke while you're
				channeling though, because that'll cancel it.</li>
			<li>Don't change your orbs in Ghost Walk. Pressing any hotkey will instantly dispel your invis. Ideally,
				you'll want to throw up 3 Wexes before you Ghost Walk, but you'll rarely be able to pull that off in a
				gank situation.</li>
			<li>Ice Wall is actually ridiculous in the mid lane matchup. With 3 points in Quas it's a 60% slow. If
				someone's making a move on your high ground and you're trying to shake them off, you can potentially get
				even more return damage by casting Ice Wall instead of Cold Snap.</li>
			<li>With practice, you can lay Ice Wall perpendicularly to catch escaping enemies. It's effectively a 650
				range slow if you can aim it right.</li>
			<li>Learn and practice the stereotypical Invoker combos: EMP+Tornado, Forge Spirits+Cold Snap, Chaos
				Meteor+Sun Strike+Deafening Blast, Forge Spirits+Alacrity, Tornado+Sun Strike, Ice Wall+Being the
				greatest spell in Voker's arsenal that is criminally underused.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always keep tabs on the spells he has Invoked by clicking on him to get a better idea of how he's
				building. If you're mid and he has Sun Strike invoked, warn your team. If he's missing and he's been
				going Q/W, tell them to watch out for a Tornado from the trees.</li>
			<li>Try to remember he has Sun Strike BEFORE you think you narrowly escaped the first gank of the game,
				rather than after.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits burn off your armor with each of their attacks. Invoker isn't just harassing you just to
				be a dick. Well he is, but he's also trying to soften you up for whatever is about to happen next.</li>
