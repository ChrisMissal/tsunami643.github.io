		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the ins and outs of the Stifling Dagger are critical to not getting demolished in lane.
				Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each
				level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.</li>
			<li>If an enemy in your lane has a Magic Stick, cast your Daggers from fog whenever possible. Stick only gains charges
				from spells that are cast in vision.</li>
			<li>Stifling Dagger applies whatever on-hit effects your hero has like Orb of Venom or Basher. If you go invis from
				Shadow Blade/Silver Edge while the Dagger is traveling, it'll deal the Shadow Walk bonus damage on impact.</li>
			<li>Since Stifling Dagger applies a 'right click' on a target, casting it will break your Smoke when the projectile lands.</li>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.</li>
			<li>Get an early point in Blur when laning. If not for the evasion, get it for detection purposes. If you suddenly
				become de-Blurred, a hero is likely coming to gank you in a 1600 radius.</li>
			<li>You can also use the Blur buff to scout enemies when roaming around the map or to check for an enemy presence in the Rosh pit.
				Pay attention to the Buff, it'll save your life.</li>
			<li>Blur can detect heroes through Smoke and invisibility.</li>
			<li>Coup de Grâce makes it incredibly frustrating to grab CS while pushing, so take down the creeps that are
				being focused the least when the waves clash (ranged creep first, then that one melee creep that was
				late to the party, then that's about it).</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>A Magic Stick may be a good investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to
				spam Dagger.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, get a MKB or Bloodthorn. If you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter for survivability or Solar Crest for the
				accuracy. If you're tanky, get a Blade Mail.</li>
			<li>Silver Edge can Break her evasion and her crit.</li>
			<li>Chain Lightning procs from Maelstrom or Mjollnir cannot be evaded, giving you a stealth 25% accuracy item.</li>
			<li>PA cannot Phantom Strike when rooted.</li>
			<li>The minimap will not help you against PA. Many times you'll be farming your lane and you'll see a mass
				of creeps hanging out at one of your towers on the map and you'll think, "Eh, no one's there, the tower
				will push it back." Then all of a sudden PA is knocking on your tier 2. Actually pan around the map to
				verify if PA is truly off the map or not.</li>
