		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Stack your Imprisonments on the same target, especially if they are INT heroes since it'll cut their
				right click damage. It's also okay to also stack Imprisonments on heroes with high-cost spells, like
				Tiny and Pudge, so they are too dumb to cast anything.</li>
			<li>Time Imprisonments right before the enemy goes for a last hit. It's super annoying to get Harbinged
				right before killing a creep.</li>
			<li>Try to pull off an Imprisonment on an enemy before using your ult. At level 16, one Imprisonment should
				give you an extra ~200 magical damage on that target and ~100 extra damage on everyone else. Just make
				sure you're not Imprisoning a high priority target that needed to get targeted by the rest of your team.</li>
			<li>If you're getting ganked in the early game, try using a Bottle charge or some sort of regen item right
				before self-Imprisoning yourself. The regen will continue healing while you're banished.</li>
			<li>You want to use Sanity's Eclipse as early in a team fight as possible so that you can actually take
				advantage of the fat mana burn on some heroes. WHOA IT HAS A MANA BURN? It has a mana burn.</li>
			<li>Refresher beats Agh in both giving you a stronger right click and in buffing Sanity's Eclipse. That
				being said, you probably shouldn't be going for either of these unless you're in a 70 minute game or
				against 5 strength heroes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Nyx nyx nyx nyx. Mana Burn is the most anti-OD spell in the game.</li>
			<li>Pugna pugna pugna pugna. Nether Ward is the second most anti-OD spell in the game.</li>
			<li>Bkb bkb bkb bkb. Spell immunity is the most anti-OD state in the game.</li>
			<li>The Imprisonment ends when the orange circle at the top fully expands (once the spell is maxed).</li>
