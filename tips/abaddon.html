		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can deny yourself using Mist Coil.</li>
			<li>The self-damage on Mist Coil can be absorbed by Aphotic Shield and can heal you during Borrowed Time.</li>
			<li>Mist Coil can heal through BKB/spell immunity.</li>
			<li>You can put Aphotic Shield on siege creeps.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield will always detonate for the full damage regardless of damage absorbed. This means that
				you can replace a shield on an ally to detonate it on demand for the damage.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield's explosion won't damage units in fog or invisible units, even if they're in the AoE.</li>
			<li>Abaddon's cast animations are long and the cast range on Aphotic Shield is garbage. If you're
				pushing/defending with your team and you're worried about enemy initiation, try casting and canceling
				Aphotic Shield on your team's highest priority hero. Not only will this constantly keep you in range to
				cast the shield, but if you've got them arteezy reactions you can almost instantly wipe off any disable.</li>
			<li>If you or an ally gets attacked by a hero while Aphotic Shield is on, the game will act like you haven't
				taken damage from that hero. This means that salves, clarities, bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, Recall, and
				sleeps won't get broken.</li>
			<li>You don't need to actually complete an attack to get the Curse of Avernus buff. During chases or
				escapes, you can animation cancel an attack on a neutral or a creep to give yourself a free 15% move
				speed bonus without having to wait through Abaddon's full attack animation. If you have Tranquils this
				is doubly important since it allows you to get the move speed buff without breaking your boots.</li>
			<li>Curse of Avernus works on towers.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield doesn't absorb any damage during Borrowed Time, all of it goes to healing.</li>
			<li>Borrowed Time can be activated manually to disjoint projectiles (like stuns) or you can manually cast it
				while stunned to purge it off.</li>
			<li>The self-damage taken from Armlet can heal you under Borrowed Time. This is a bug.</li>
			<li>Abaddon is an ideal hero to keep auras on (Vlad's, Basi, Drum, Shiva's) since he takes too much time for
				teams to kill early on in a fight.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The burst damage radius on Aphotic Shield is pretty huge (675).</li>
			<li>If a target with Aphotic Shield is trying to explode on you, try to abuse fog of war. If the enemy can't
				see you, the Shield detonation won't do any damage.</li>
			<li>If you have a nuke that does >400 damage, you can instakill Abaddon without Borrowed Time ever auto
				triggering.</li>
			<li>If you don't trust your team, Eul's is a great Abaddon counter since it can waste 2.5s of Borrowed
				Time.</li>
			<li>AA's Ice Blast prevents Abaddon from healing during Borrowed Time.</li>
