		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Each Meepo is counting as a hero to split XP. If you have 3 Meepos and 1 Dazzle in the lane, Meepo is
				getting 75% of the experience, even though there are technically only 2 heroes there.</li>
			<li>When fountain diving, be sure to make liberal use of the use the a+click on an ally (in this case,
				another Meepo) to drop fountain aggro.</li>
			<li>The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there
				should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep
				one somewhere safe in the jungle.</li>
			<li>If you don't have the micro skills for the Blink to Superpoof combo, consider getting a Shadow Blade to
				do it.</li>
			<li>Enabling quickcast in your options will generally make Poofing much, much, simpler.</li>
			<li>You can Poof to illusions owned by you.</li>
			<li>Activating a DD rune applies the rune to any Meepos within a 500 radius.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Earthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to
				predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.</li>
		</ul>
