		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Grave Chill any non-allied unit. If you see the enemy mid coming to gank you in lane, just Chill
				the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you're trying to catch up to an enemy for a final Soul
				Assumption, Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.</li>
			<li>Donâ€™t sit on Soul Assumption charges. Instead of struggling to land a Familiar stun in a team fight
				before realizing that they all died in the chaos, worry about using Soul Assumption every time you have
				full bars.</li>
			<li>There are many other ways to use Familiars other than just for keeping you company. Use Brooklyn and
				Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, put them behind a lane and use them to
				distract the next creep wave before a dive.</li>
			<li>In most team fights, you'll usually want to have your Familiars spit on the enemy's squishiest support.
				Not only can these supports not take the abuse, but most don't have a way of easily getting rid of the
				birds either.</li>
			<li>Familiars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor, like Medallion.</li>
			<li>The simplest way to Familiar stun is through unit tabbing. Grave Chill the enemy, tab to a Familiar,
				press Q, tab again, wait around 1 second, Q again, Assume some Souls, get some kills.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Orb of Venom can burn off all layers of Gravekeeper's Cloak levels 1 and 2 in just one hit. Most other
				DoTs will also quickly burn off layers.</li>
			<li>You can't stun/hex familiars. Well you can try, but you won't stop them from flying away.</li>
		</ul>
