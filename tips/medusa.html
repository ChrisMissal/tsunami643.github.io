		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're hitting a single target and Split Shot is toggled on, you're still taking the damage nerf.
				Stop taking Rosh or pushing creepless towers with Split Shot on.</li>
			<li>Illusions will either have Split Shot on or off depending on how you had it toggled before they
				spawned.</li>
			<li>The way the damage scales on Mystic Snake is opposite of Fade Bolt. You're gaining damage for each
				target hit, not losing it. Don't shoot the Snake directly at the enemy hero in lane if you want to get
				the max damage.</li>
			<li>"Damn, I really wished I had Mana Shield turned off before that gank," said no Medusa ever. At a certain
				point in the game (read: after the laning phase) there are very few reasons to ever have Mana Shield
				turned off. Only if you're unsure if you'll have mana to use Stone Gaze should you have it off.</li>
			<li>Even though enemies have full magic resistance when in Stone Form, Mystic Snake will deal pure damage to
				any petrified targets.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you don't know where Medusa is in the first 2 minutes of the game, then you know exactly where Medusa
				is. The ancient strat is cute, but also pretty simple to counter. You got the "Put a ward to block the
				camp," the "sentry her ward so she doesn't know what to do," the old "sit around and intermittently
				harass her so she can't decide if you've left her alone yet or not," the crafty "cut an extra tree down
				and watch her panic," and the classic "bring 3 heroes in to waste her and then take her stacks."</li>
			<li>If you don't know where Medusa is in the next 40 minutes of the game, then you know exactly why Medusa
				isn't a popular hero. If you can't beat the enemies 4v5 in the midgame, then you weren't going to beat
				them late anyway.</li>
			<li>When a Mystic Snake gets tossed out on the lane ask yourself, "Would Fade Bolt be able to jump to me
				from here?" If you said yes, then you probably already got hit by it.</li>
			<li>Remember that Diffusal is no longer an orb effect, so consider if it's worth getting to counter Dusa's
				Mana Shield.</li>
