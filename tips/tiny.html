		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Avalanche has a short delay before the stun connects, so try to slightly lead it if you can. You don't
				need to go full Leshrac, but you're not going to hit someone who's running from the outskirts of the
				AoE.</li>
			<li>Avalanche is constantly stunning in the AoE, so you can throw it in advance, like Ice Path, if you know
				a hero will be in the AoE before it finishes (mid-banish, pre-TP).</li>
			<li>Toss damages buildings if a unit lands on it.</li>
			<li>Toss breaks channels through spell immunity, including your allies'. Don't Toss your Sandy Claws until
				he finishes channeling Epicenter.</li>
			<li>You can Toss people to runes.</li>
			<li>Let your right clicks finish. Tiny's attack speed is constantly changing throughout the course of the
				game, which makes it a real pain to consistently cancel his backswing animation. Err on the side of
				caution and be patient.Â </li>
			<li>You want to cast Toss slightly after Avalanche connects to get the full combo damage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>As long as the rocks are flying around, an Avalanche will stun you if you walk into the AoE.</li>
			<li>Craggy Exterior will make you froth at the mouth if you're a melee carry, so get a BKB.</li>
			<li>Tiny has no armor to start. Coupled with his super slow attack animation, Tiny can't trade hits very
				well in lane.</li>
		</ul>
