		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The capture radius on Searing Chains is huge, but that's usually a disadvantage since it means you'll
				probably catch creeps when you want to catch heroes. When possible, hold on to the Chains until you can
				position yourself away from worthless enemy units rather than <s>complaining about</s> relying on RNG.</li>
			<li>While Sleighted, projectiles will follow you around as you bounce from unit to unit. It's not a
				disjoint, but you can use this invulnerability period to 'absorb' projectiles without taking any damage
				or stun.</li>
			<li>You can use items during Sleight of Fist. This includes TP scrolls. Just be sure that your Sleight ends
				before the TP channel finishes, otherwise you'll be brought back to your Sleight remnant.</li>
			<li>You can use spells during Sleight of Fist. Yes, Chains is a given, but casting and activating Remnants
				during Sleight is also important. You can cast Remnants mid-Sleight to close distances quicker when
				chasing and activating them at the tail end of a Sleight will make you extremely difficult to lock down
				when being chased.</li>
			<li>The hardest part of executing the Sleight+Chain combo is knowing when Sleight will actually go off.
				Don't get too excited and prematurely cast Chains first. Just hit the hotkey as soon as you can react to
				Ember going into Sleight and you'll probably land it.</li>
			<li>When manfighting early on with a low level Sleight, keep the Sleight in your pocket until the end of the
				fight. With good timing, you can use the banishment phase of the Sleight to mask the backswing of one of
				your attacks while tripping up heroes who are mashing right click on you, stalling some potential auto
				attacks.</li>
			<li>Your Remnants travel at 2.5x your move speed when cast. This means that you should avoid casting fresh
				Remnants if you're trying to escape when you're slowed.</li>
			<li>This also applies to weird 'leash' spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field and Slark's Pounce. If you walk
				to the very limit of the leash then your move speed is considered zero and your Remnant won't go
				anywhere.</li>
			<li>You can pick up items (such as Aegis) or runes while traveling to a Remnant.</li>
			<li>The explosion damage radius of an activated Remnant is actually larger than the Searing Chains capture
				radius. If you're about to gank someone, cast a Remnant to the side of them that has the fewest enemy
				units, rather than directly on top of them.</li>
			<li>Remnants give a small amount of basic vision. They're no Beastmaster Hawks, but they can be useful when
				trying to get vision inside the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>You can also use the Remnant vision to help track someone who's escaping in fog since Searing Chains can't
				catch units in fog.</li>
			<li>Use Remnants for mobility purposes as well as damage. Toss one out before teleporting back to base so
				you can quickly get back out on the lane. Toss one out before dying so you can get back out on the map
				as soon as you respawn (or buyback).</li>
			<li>Remnants have a 45 seconds duration but a 35 second recharge time. This means that you have a 10 second
				window to use 4 Remnants in a gank if you have one pre-casted. This is mainly useful for mid lane
				matchups.</li>
			<li>I highly recommend using the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">dota_disable_range_finder
																												 0</font><br><br>console
				command when playing Ember. It becomes far easier to tell when Sleight of Fist will go off and you'll be
				able to exploit the full Remnant cast range during ganks and escapes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Whenever Ember uses Sleight, he leaves a temporary Remnant behind during the cast. This is where he'll
				always return once Sleight finishes. Use this as a beacon to set up stuns like Mirana's Arrow or
				Jakiro's Ice Path or just start mashing your silence/hex/disable on the temporary remnant so you can
				catch him as soon as he returns.</li>
			<li>Ember hates silences, but he also really hates slows. The travel speed on Remnant casts scale off of
				Ember's own move speed, so heroes with strong slows can cut Ember's aggression significantly since he'll
				need to pre-cast an escape Remnant before going in.</li>
			<li>Ember consumes all currently spawned Remnants when he activates one. If an Ember just Remnant'd in on a
				teammate, it can be worth following up and chasing to force him to cast an escape Remnant.</li>
			<li>Sleight of Fist gets affected by evasion, disarms, and damage block.</li>
			<li>You can purge off Flame Guard. This makes Eul's a solid item to have against Ember.</li>
			<li>Levels 1 and 2 of Flame Guard won't cancel Salves.</li>
