		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Purification has an extremely long cast animation, but you can use this to your advantage in lane. Most
				melee heroes will immediately back off a last hit if they see Omni start throwing down prayers. So cast
				it and cancel it.</li>
			<li>Spam Repel. If you're sitting around babysitting a carry in lane and everyone is off the map, use it. If
				you're going into dangerous areas to ward, use it. If you envision some sort of 3600 range initiation
				possibly happening when the two teams are toeing off, use it. You get 12 Omniscient seconds of spell
				immunity for 50 mana. If your ally is straight stupid and doesn't reposition themselves at the end of
				the duration they deserve to get punished for the two seconds before it comes off CD again. Yes, it's
				great when you can get enemies to waste their stuns and then Repel them off, but most of the time your
				allies will get killed first because your cast animation takes like 20 minutes and the range on Repel is
				pretty lame.</li>
			<li>One of the few uses of offensive Repels is to purge off enemy runes or spells like Surge. Pretty much
				the only other use is to take an enemy out of Naga sleep. Other than that, you misclicked and you should
				feel bad.</li>
			<li>Use Guardian Angel more like a Mek than Shallow Grave. There's no reason you can't start getting dat
				Omniscient love with your team once they're all at half HP, rather than in Culling Blade range.</li>
			<li>Omniscience is core for fountain diving. Guardian Angel will completely negate any damage from the
				fountain machine gun.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Probably the best hero in the game to get a Diffusal Blade against. Lifestealer running away with a
				sliver of health and Guardian Angel? Purge it. Storm Spirit being an annoying dick and diving in 2 tiers
				deep because he's Repelled? HeyyyyloeverybodythisisPurge it. The fact that Omni is also worthless if you
				burn off all his mana is just gravy.</li>
			<li>Eul's Cyclone, Invoker's Tornado, and Storm Panda's Cyclone (and obviously Purge) can also dispel
				Guardian Angel. As does Oracle's Fortune's End and Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge.</li>
			<li>Rubick's wet dream. "Oh I better cast something before Rubick steals Guardian Angel... but I don't want
				him getting Repel. Wait, I don't want him getting Purification either..."</li>
		</ul>
