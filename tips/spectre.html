		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The collisionless grace period on Spectral Dagger is pretty generous. Even if you toss the Dagger one
				way and walk in the opposite way, you still get ~2 seconds of collisonless phasing. So if you don't need
				to create a huge gap, you can toss the Dagger at your enemies to slow them and then escape down a cliff
				or across some trees in the other direction.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger's slow goes through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>Desolate never misses. It goes through both blinds and evasion.</li>
			<li>Dispersion reflects damage that you would have taken. Therefore, every time you die from max health,
				28.2% of your HP pool is reflected as AoE pure damage (it's more than the 22% due to the increased EHP
				that Dispersion gives you). This means that the only way to buff Dispersion damage is to increase your
				HP pool, not by building armor or other damage mitigation.</li>
			<li>If you have 2 lives (buyback, Aegis) save Haunt for your second one. Dispersion from your first death
				will leave the enemy team low, allowing your Haunts to do clean up work.</li>
			<li>Spectre doesn't have a farming steroid like most carries. However, Haunt allows her to perpetually farm
				lanes or split push because she can instantly participate in a team fight on demand.</li>
			<li>Haunt illusions start with a 400 base move speed, which means not only do they have an easy time
				sticking to their target, but +% move speed items like Yasha or Drums are even more effective on them.</li>
			<li>You can use Reality multiple times during a Haunt cast. You swap positions with each illusion that you
				Reality to, so it can be useful for picking up a kill on a retreating hero and then warping back into
				the fight or back to lane.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spectre might as well be holding a pool noodle as a weapon for the first 15 minutes of the game.
				Spectral Dagger is way too expensive to offensively spam, Desolate nearly irrelevant in lane because
				she's too slow to consistently harass and there are creeps everywhere, and Dispersion's payoff is low
				when her HP pool is mediocre and the damage being dealt isn't high. If you shut her down early, her lack
				of a farming skill to fall back on will gimp the enemy team big time.</li>
			<li>Haunt illusions can be slowed and hexes will instantly kill them, but they can't be stunned, body
				blocked, juked, or otherwise prevented from rubbing themselves all over squishy supports.</li>
			<li>Whenever she Haunts, stand next to your creeps or give your teammates a hug. For most of the early to
				mid game her only Haunt damage is coming from Desolate, so don't let it proc.</li>
			<li>Spec doesn't do much damage to Roshan, she's bad at taking towers, and she has pretty miserable AGI gain
				for a carry. This means that when you lose a team fight, Spec's team won't be able to take too many
				objectives.</li>
			<li>Spell immunity ignores damage from Desolate and Dispersion, making BKB a solid pickup against Spec.</li>
