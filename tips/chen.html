		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you've got nothing better to do early game as Chen, try finding a Wildwing and just send it mid.
				Start a Tornado and sic it on the enemy mid. Alternatively, find a Harpy and constantly cast Chain
				Lightning on the enemy mid. Congratulations, you just won mid lane.</li>
			<li>Don't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in
				the lane and try to pick up last hits, or send them to jungle/ancient camps and start stacking.</li>
			<li>The net on the Dark Troll Warlord goes through spell immunity and Linken's Sphere.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through
				his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.</li>
			<li>Heroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Crystal Maiden's Frostbite,
				Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, Lifestealer's Infest, and Clinkz's Death Pact are a few specific
				examples.</li>
