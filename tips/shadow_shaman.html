		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ether Shock can hit secondary units ~400 units further away than its cast range. If an enemy is making a
				run for it and is just out of cast range, cast the Shock on the ranged creep right behind them.</li>
			<li>The facts on Hex: Instant cast time, insta-kills illusions, and is super annoying. Spam cast and cancel
				this spell on the enemy team's initiator when you're toeing off. The moment they blink in and are in
				range, they'll be Rhasta Fried Chicken.</li>
			<li>Shackles deals damage in a bunch of tiny instances, making it very effective for burning off things like
				Refraction or Living Armor.</li>
			<li>As cute as it is to spawn your Serpents in a circle around a tower singing kumbaya, you never want to do
				this. Your wards hurt, but only when they're all able to attack at the same time. When you spawn them in
				a huge circle, even a Pugna can take them on one by one.</li>
			<li>Don't let enemies farm your Wards for free if they win a teamfight. It's fairly easy to cannibal deny your
				wards. It takes 2 attacks from a hero to kill a ward. Select one lone Ward in the back and have it murder its
				siblings after one hero attack.</li>
			<li>The Serpent Wards are controllable units. This hero is one of the few 'micro' heroes that box selection
				is encouraged on. Square your Serpents (or double click one, that'll select them all), tell them to stop
				spitting on creeps, and reorient them on the tower that you were trying to kill or on that 1HP
				armlet-toggling Naix that inadvertently limped back into your wards' range.</li>
			<li>There is no secret to landing Ward Traps other than practice. It's a skillshot, just learn the cast
				animation and range.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're ward trapped, you can Phase through the serpents using Phase Boots or certain invis/windwalk
				abilities.</li>
			<li>Mass Serpent Ward costs a ton of mana, making Rhasta a great candidate for Mana Burning/Leaking or
				picking Pugna against.</li>
			<li>You can break these cuffs. Always have a stun/silence ready on your team to bail a teammate out from the
				Shackle channel. At level 4, Shackles disable for nearly as long as Bane's ultimate.</li>
		</ul>
