What are you doing here?

This is all the resources to my "Tsunami's Dota Tips and Counters" site aka www.howdoiplay.com

The typeahead that I use is https://github.com/corejavascript/typeahead.js

I guess I use... some jQuery too? Man I don't know, I'm not a coder. This is just a pet project of mine.
